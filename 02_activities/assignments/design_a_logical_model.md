# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```
Your answer...
```

--Overwrite changes Type 1
DROP Table IF EXISTS CUSTOMER_ADDRESS;
CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER_ADDRESS (
    CustomerAddressID INT PRIMARY KEY,
	CustomerName VARCHAR(50),
    Address VARCHAR(100),
    City VARCHAR(50),
    Province VARCHAR(50),
    PostCode VARCHAR(10)
);

--Retain changes by adding new row, filter by Move_Out_Date Type 2
DROP Table IF EXISTS CUSTOMER_ADDRESS;
CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER_ADDRESS (
    CustomerAddressID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(50),
    Address VARCHAR(100),
    City VARCHAR(50),
    Province VARCHAR(50),
    PostCode VARCHAR(10),
    Move_In_Date DATE,
    Move_Out_Date DATE,
    IsCurrent BOOLEAN
);

Type 1 (Overwrite changes), minimal privacy implications. It shows the most recent address that stored as the historical record are not saved. However, current information still need to be safeguarded by only accessible for authorized people.
Type 2 (Retain changes), higher privacy implications. All the historical data as well as current address is on file. it means more detailed personal data are stored and the leaking risk exposure is higher than Type 1.

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```
Your answer...
```

1. Complexity
AdventureWorks: There are many tables stand for different entities and have numerous relationships. E.g. sales schema including few tables like salesPerson, Store, CreditCard, SalesTaxRate etc.
My ERD: it is less complexity with fewer tables and less relationships. For previous created Sales tables, it only includes few info like SalesID, OrderID etc.

2. Segmentation by using Schema
AdventureWorks: The schema is divided into 6 components, including sales/ purchasing/ person / production/ HR/ DBO, within each schema, it includes tables that related to specific business functions and make the graph more logically and easy to find specific function part.
My ERD: Not using schema to illustrate the segment, but instead having tables separately by following the guide. It makes the whole database less organized and hard to manage once the input data become more and more.
