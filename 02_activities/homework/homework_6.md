**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

By going through my previous workings, particularly the SQL queries, I realize the language is more on the technical side while bypassing the ethical considerations and inequity problems. For data management and database operations, to address the above two parts, we need to make sure the key ethics principles of fairness, privacy, transparency being applied, and the maker would have accountability to the model created.

From an ethical perspective, it is important to make sure the data were collected in an integrity way and be transparent about how data is used to ensure the compliance about data protection regulatory. Moreover, protecting data privacy by focusing on cyber security is also crucial.  When using data, it requires more attention to be sure they are used or manipulated in a correct way by validating the result in different manners.

In terms of equity, it is important to keep in mind that data operations might impact different parties. If some tables including Material Nonpublic Information (MNPI) like data related to IPOs, acquisitions, stock buyback etc., it is crucial to create dummy / temp table to aggerate them in case any change of the data information might impact the accuracy of the original data and used it in anonymous way to prevent it from misuse or leaking. Furthermore, ensuring data is up to date and unbiased fairly stored by enhancing company internal control process and go through audit trail regularly.

By considering the ethical and equity component in our day-to-day data operation process, we could ensure that our data practice would be both technically feasible and ethically trusted.
